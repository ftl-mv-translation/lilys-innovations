<![CDATA[
An addon that add new and alternative SHIP SYSTEMS to allow for new and interesting playstyles.

ATTENTION: Requires FTLMAN mod loader
Will NOT work properly with SLIPSTREAM

Recommended to patch LAST - or at least after mods that add ships.



Special thanks to: 
Nai, for ideas and spriting work;
Arc, sillysandvich, for help with scripting;
Willow, for help with writing;
Kix, and everyone else who have worked on creating FTL: Multiverse (and Hyperspace);

		Suggestions for the description...

		Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship, how
		does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

		Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

		Optionally list important features.

		List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or requirements.

		Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
			Kestrel-A, Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Zoltan-A,
			Stealth-A, Rock-A,    Slug-A,    Mantis-A,
			Lanius-A,  Crystal-A

		Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
		that again for each new version.
